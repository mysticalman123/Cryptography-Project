# Cryptography-Project
This project demonstrates the theory of Cryptography

So far I've implemented one function for cryptography which is the Caesar function.
The Encrypt button encrypts the text in the text box.
The Decrypt button decrypts the text in the text box.
The find Keys button searches for possible keys to decrypt the text using three essential words "the", "or" and "is". It returns a list of possible keys.
